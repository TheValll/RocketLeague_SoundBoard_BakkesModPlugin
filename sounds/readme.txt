## Changing Sounds ðŸŽ¶

You can replace the default sounds with your own. To do so:

- **Keep the same file names** as the originals (e.g., `goal.wav`, `save.wav`).
- All sound files **must be in `.wav` format**.
- Additional sounds can be found in the `another-sounds` folder or on websites like [MyInstants](https://www.myinstants.com/en/index/fr/).

### Notes:

- There is currently **no functionality to change sound volume in the plugin**. You will need to adjust the volume using an external audio or video editor before importing the sound files.
- To disable a sound, simply **delete the corresponding `.wav` file** from the folder.
